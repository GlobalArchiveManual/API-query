# To do list
HIGH PRIORITY
- Clean data for
  - Geographe
  - Ningaloo
  - South-west corner (lowest priority)
- Fix up script to download data
- Write script to merge with life history information
- Calculate abundance by size class for size of maturity
- Plot with bubble plot by species and size class for indicator species
- Temporal plot by zone


- Duplicate combinations of ['caab', 'campaignid', 'sample'] in count files.
- Unknown Annotation Subjects - probably SPPPPPPPPs.
- Missing observer.X, despite being marked as successful.X
- Referential integrity issues (missing referenced sample), but this is probably just a result of samples being dropped for above reasons.


LOW PRIORITY
- Turn habitat data into levels
- Upload to synthesis on GlobalArchive API
- Write script to summarise data and plot with scatter pies
